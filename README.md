# 2D-HP-Protein-Folder
The code part of an undergrad university project. A basic look at the SAW model and approximation algorithms using the HP protein model.
It is an experiemntal project written in Python using Tkinter as the UI, held together by tape and hope. To my knowledge though, it works as intended.

In the current state (the assessed state) it does not provide a particuarly good medium for a study of approximation algorithms due to the nature of the implemented in-plane moves. A continuiation of the project should see the implementation of other move types, particuarly the pull move for more subtle moves that may see substantial significence in the variation of the result of the algorithms selected.
